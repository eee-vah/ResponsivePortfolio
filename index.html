        <p class="bio">Hi! My name is Eva Trinh (eee-vah) and I love to create. I'm a born in Texas, raised in Oklahoma girl that likes solving puzzles in data, coding, and in life while drinking my favorite beverages: jasmine milk tea with boba or black milk tea with egg pudding. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma (BOOMER SOONER) with my Bachelors in Science - Health and Social Sciences and my Masters in Public Health - Occupational and Environmental Health.</p>
        <p class="crochet"> My favorite puzzle to solve, currently, is amigurumi crocheting. Amigurumi is the Japanese art of crocheting stuffed animals. I love to crochet cute things for my loved ones and their babies. The projects featured on this site were made to celebrate new life, show appreciation towards loved ones, and remember those who are no longer with us. Thank you for visiting! I hope you enjoy perusing my projects as much as I enjoyed making them.</p>
